# Data Base Management Systems Project - Khushi's Designer Boutique

## About the Client
Mrs. Khushi Arora owns a popular Boutique in Connaught Place, New Delhi. She has a great 
collection of different kinds of dresses, saris, suits and other apparel for different occasions and she 
has clients from all age groups ranging from teenage students to elderly people. She finds it difficult 
to maintain multiple registers and manually keep a track of the total garments sold, total profit earned, 
list of all the distributors, amount of new garments to be ordered, salaries of employees and customer 
preferences. Moreover, last year due to covid-19, the boutique was closed for a large part of the year 
and therefore sales have been down by 58%. She therefore wants to enable her customers to place 
orders online so that they donâ€™t have to bother coming to the boutique to buy garments. She hopes that 
her business expands and reaches a wider audience through this move.
Therefore she requires a website that can cater to the needs of her customers and at the same time 
allow her staff to work and maintain records efficiently.

## Objective

stated by the client to ease the Data Management for their boutique and to build a fully functional
